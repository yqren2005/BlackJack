Implemented a simple Blackjack game in Python.

Here is my BlackJack rule:

1. If you get BlackJack, bet payout is 3:2.
2. If your point is not good, you may Surrender but half bet will be taken.
3. You can select DoubleDown, only 1 more card will be hit, and bet will be doubled.
4. You can Split once. After Split, Re-split or Doubledown or Surrender is NOT allowed.
5. ACE by default is 11. If your 1st 2 cards are ACEs, your point is 12. If you choose Hit, and if your point becomes > 21, then any ACE could be reduced to 1, or both can if needed.
6. Dealer will always hit if his point is < 17 (even if his point might >= yours) and must stand if it is >= 17.
    
Enjoy!
